What I wish to propose is an extension to mallika's idea.
She spoke about integrating our personal schedules and creating a calender, with professors having admin rights t change and modify things.

I think we can add to it by creating another tab ,one each ,for uploading our notes-relevant pdf\s and slides;
                                                                   journals-to take notes for each subject;
                                                                   and tools wih a link to git repositories
                                                                   
                                                                   
Plus mallika talked about chat box to implement websocket.
Can we also use-a reminder? to send alerts to our phone from our calender? For that we can use push bullet:its a web app to send alerts to phone;
We can embedd it in our web applicaton.

What do you guys think?
